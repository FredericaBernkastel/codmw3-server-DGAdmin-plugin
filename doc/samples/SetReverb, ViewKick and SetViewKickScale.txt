Hello guys

This is a new tutorial, half mw2, half mw3. I have been looking at some mw3 gsc files, and I thought of explaining some commands, the first one of all is setreverb, is a sound command, I recomend you to search on google what does reverb means.

self SetReverb("priority","roomtype",drylevel,wetlevel,fadetime);

An example(I dont know very well the priority thing, but this one is in the gsc file, so it should work, the rest of parametres is just change parametres):

self SetReverb("snd_enveffectsprio_level","quarry",1,0.5,0);

Roomtype list(taken from mw3 gsc files)

Now second command, viewkick, it changes your angles as if they have shot you, Smile

self ViewKick(power,origin);

Examples:

self ViewKick(3,self.origin); //small
self ViewKick(100,self.origin); //big

I found a command at mw3 gsc files which has something in relation with this and I am fully sure that works like this:

self SetViewKickScale(scale);

Examples:

self setViewKickScale(0); //no effect of bullet hits on your aiming
self setViewKickScale(0.5); //sharpfocus effect
